## Introduction
  Just as a little preface, this list is very much a work in progress. At the moment, the list will mostly focus on plugins for *Lightroom Classic*, *Photoshop*, and *Illustrator* since they're the ones I'm most familiar, but with contributions the list can hopefully expand to cover all Adobe products (at least the ones that support plugins). Anyway. Now that that's over, let's get onto the list.

## Illustrator
